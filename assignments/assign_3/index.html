    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Read Chapters 8-9 of the <a href="http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/index.php">Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial</a>, and Complete Related Exercises</h2>
    <p>
      There is only a single big step for this assignment: read chapters 8-9 of the <a href="http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/index.php">Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial</a>.
      Links to the individual chapters are on the left side of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercises for chapters 8-9 are provided in the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="8_exercises.pl"><code>8_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="9_exercises.pl"><code>9_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must complete all of the above exercises.
      It is recommended to first read a chapter, then complete the exercises for that chapter, as opposed to trying to read in bulk and then complete the exercises in bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the turnaround time on this assignment is pretty short, this reading should take a proportionally small amount of time.
