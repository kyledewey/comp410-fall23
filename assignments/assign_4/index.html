    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Implement a Boolean Expression Evaluator in Prolog</h2>
    <p>
      Download <a href="boolean_evaluator.pl"><code>boolean_evaluator.pl</code></a>.
      You will need to implement a recursive evaluator of Boolean expressions in this file, much like the evaluator you implemented for <a href="../assign_1">Assignment 1</a>.
      This will be implemented via a procedure (that is, a combination of facts and rules which have the same name) named <code>eval</code>.
      Note that the representation of the AST has been slightly changed, corresponding to a more idiomatic Prolog representation.
      The comments in the file provide more details.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Implement a SAT Solver in Prolog</h2>
    <p>
      Download <a href="sat_solver.pl"><code>sat_solver.pl</code></a>.
      You will need to write a procedure (that is, a combination of facts and rules which have the same name) named <code>isTrue</code> which determines if a given Boolean formula is true.
      This formula has a very similar AST as the one from the SAT solver you implemented for <a href="../assign_1">Assignment 1</a>, with mostly just changes to make the representation a little more idiomatic to Prolog.
      However, there is one key difference: instead of variables in the formula being represented by atoms (or symbols for Racket), here we represent the variables using Prolog variables (i.e., logical variables).
      This effectively allows us to &ldquo;modify&rdquo; the formula in-place as we learn information about it (i.e., which variables need to be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relevant to the aforementioned representation of literals, this means the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If we have a positive literal, the Prolog variable in the literal must be equal to the atom <code>true</code>.
        That is, for a positive literal to be true, its variable must hold the value <code>true</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we have a negative literal, the Prolog variable in the literal must be equal to the atom <code>false</code>.
        That is, for a negative literal to be true, its variable must hold the value <code>false</code>, because it is negated.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The comments in the file provide further details.
    </p>
    
    <h2>(OPTIONAL BONUS WORTH +15%) Step 3: Answer Reflection Questions</h2>
    <p>
      This may come as a bit of a surprise, but you implemented a full tableau-based SAT solver in the previous step.
      However, the code is (hopefully!) a lot simpler than the code you wrote for <a href="../assign_1">Assignment 1</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download <a href="assign4_questions.txt"><code>assign4_questions.txt</code></a>.
      There are questions in this file which ask you to reflect on your implementation, in particular with how it compares and contrasts with the implementation you wrote for <a href="../assign_1">Assignment 1</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Turn in Your Solution Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></h2>
    <p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 410 class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Assignment 4&rdquo;.
      From here, you need to upload the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>boolean_evaluator.pl</code></li>
      <li><code>sat_solver.pl</code></li>
      <li><code>assign4_questions.txt</code> (only if you attempted the bonus)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other files.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
