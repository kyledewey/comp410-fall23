    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Implement Various List Operations in Prolog</h2>
    <p>
      Download <a href="list_operations.pl"><code>list_operations.pl</code></a>.
      You will need to implement a number of procedures which manipulate lists.
      The comments in <a href="list_operations.pl"><code>list_operations.pl</code></a> provide further details.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Turn in Your Solution Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></h2>
    <p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 410 class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Assignment 5&rdquo;.
      From here, you need to upload the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>list_operations.pl</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other file.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
