    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Read Chapters 1-6 of the <a href="http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/index.php">Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial</a>, and Complete Related Exercises</h2>
    <p>
      There is only a single big step for this assignment: read chapters 1-6 of the <a href="http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/index.php">Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial</a>.
      This is a relatively short textbook which is freely available online.
      Links to the individual chapters are on the left side of the screen, below the picture of the flying squirrel (do not ask me why there is a random picture of a flying squirrel there...).
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercises for chapters 2-6 are provided in the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="2_exercises.pl"><code>2_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="3_exercises.pl"><code>3_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="4_exercises.pl"><code>4_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="5_exercises.pl"><code>5_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="6_exercises.pl"><code>6_exercises.pl</code></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must complete all of the above exercises.
      It is recommended to first read a chapter, then complete the exercises for that chapter, as opposed to trying to read in bulk and then complete the exercises in bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the turnaround time on this assignment is pretty short, this reading should take a proportionally small amount of time.
