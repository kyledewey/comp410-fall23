    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Implement a Basic Grammar-Based Test Case Generator in Prolog</h2>
    <p>
      Download <a href="arithmetic_tester.pl"><code>arithmetic_tester.pl</code></a>.
      You will need to implement two procedures in this file:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>makeTest</code></li>
      <li><code>makeTestWithNums</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It is recommended to write <code>makeTest</code> first, and to make sure it's working first before moving on to <code>makeTestWithNums</code>.
      To this end, there is a test suite provided for both procedures (that is, a test suite for the test suite generator), with <code>testMakeTest</code> and <code>testMakeTestWithNums</code>, respectively.
      The comments in <a href="arithmetic_tester.pl"><code>arithmetic_tester.pl</code></a> provide further details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can implement these procedures however you wish, as long as it doesn't change how they are called.
      You can introduce as many helper procedures as you like.
      As a hint, it's possible to share some helpers between the same procedures which may help simplify things, though you are not required to implement things this way.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Turn in Your Solution Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></h2>
    <p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 410 class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Assignment 6&rdquo;.
      From here, you need to upload the following file:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>arithmetic_tester.pl</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other file.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
