    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Implement an Evaluator of Boolean Expressions</h2>
    <p>
      For this assignment, you'll be using Python.
      While Python is not generally considered a functional language, we will be writing code that is mostly functional in nature.
      Notably, we will be using immutable linked lists, as well as immutable maps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download <a href="boolean_evaluator.py"><code>boolean_evaluator.py</code></a>.
      You will need to define a recursive evaluator of Boolean expressions in this file.
      The comments in the file provide more details.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Implement a SAT Solver Based on Semantic Tableau</h2>
    <p>
      Download <a href="sat_solver.py"><code>sat_solver.py</code></a>.
      You will need to define a SAT solver using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux">semantic tableau technique</a>.
      The comments in the file provide more details.
    </p>

    <h2>(OPTIONAL BONUS WORTH +15%) Step 3: Answer Related Questions</h2>
    <p>
      Download <a href="assign1_questions.txt"><code>assign1_questions.txt</code></a>.
      There are two questions in this file, related to how you might implement two possible extensions to your SAT solver implementation.
      You do <b>not</b> need to write any code for this portion, though you may write short snippets if it'd help explain your approach.
      I'm interested in seeing your general approach to these problems; there are many possible correct answers.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Turn in Your Answers Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></h2>
    <p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 410 class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Assignment 1&rdquo;.
      From here, you need to upload the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>boolean_evaluator.py</code></li>
      <li><code>sat_solver.py</code></li>
      <li><code>assign1_questions.txt</code> (only if you attempted the bonus)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other files.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
